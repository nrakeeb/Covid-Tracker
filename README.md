# G7-Covid-Tracker

A dynamic application to preview and interact with a geolocation API & Covid19 database.
This is a work in progress which we may revisit in the future. 
(Under development) by Mustafa Ali, Nouha Rakeeb, Mohammad Zafar. 

Created on the following user story:

```
AS a policy maker
I WANT to quickly gather Covid19 statistics for G7 countries
SO THAT I can analyse this information 
GIVEN a Covid19 dashboard with user inputs
WHEN I search or select a country 
THEN I am presented with 3 statistics (total cases, recovered and deaths) 
WHEN I view a country’s statistics
THEN I am presented with a linear chart showing the history of these values

```
