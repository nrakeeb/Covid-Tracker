# Covid-Tracker

A dynamic application to preview and interact with a geolocation API & Covid19 database.
This is a work in progress which we may revisit in the future. 
(Under development) by Mustafa Ali, Nouha Rakeeb, Mohammad Zafar. 

Created on the following user story:

```
AS a policy maker
I WANT to quickly gather Covid19 statistics for Countries
SO THAT I can analyse this information 
GIVEN a Covid19 dashboard with user inputs
WHEN I search or select a country 
THEN I am presented with 3 statistics (total cases, recovered and deaths) 
WHEN I view a countryâ€™s statistics
THEN I am presented with a linear chart showing the history of these values

```
## Description
With the use of the ip geolocation api, when user enters the webside they are automatically presented with the stats of the country they are based.
This will present three statistics of total cases, recovered, and deaths. It will also present a chart with the country statstics throughout the months.
User are able to see other countries by typing the country they desire in the search bar. 
All previous searches will be displayed once input box is clicked.
